# WSLH - Product documentation

For the course "Web App From Scratch" everyone was tasked to design and build a Single Page web App (SPA) based on a user story. The teachers gave us about three weeks for this assignment. The catch is that we had to retrieve data from an external API, manipulate and display said data, but only by using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## User Story :soccer:

As you might already be aware, I developed a football application to keep you up-to-date with your favorite teams in the FA Women's Super League. I have enjoyed football for as long as I can remember, I was practically raised in a Galatasaray household where we watched games with the family every weekend. To no one's surprised, I ended up playing football myself as well, however I never actually joined a team. I played on the streets with my friends and occasionaly went to a local club to use their pitches.

Back then, women's football was not really a thing. Besides my laziness and dislike for attending training sessions, there were barely any girl football teams.
